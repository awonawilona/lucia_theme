## Note: Based in Stylus, please check the library folder if you are looking to change any CSS Styles, if you are totally lost, stat for:

http://stylus-lang.com/


So Theme Check (http://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/)
is constantly telling me that it needs these classes in the CSS even
though they are in the REAL stylesheet in library/css/style.css.
So we're gonna drop these here to keep it happy.
Great work, Theme Check (eye roll)
